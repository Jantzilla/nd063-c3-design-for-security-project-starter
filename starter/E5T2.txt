# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

## Scan infrastructure as code templates

I would use "CloudSploit" to scan for IaC vulnerabilities.

### Example vulnerability

An example vulnerability that CloudSploit might expose is the inclusion of an overly permissive security group in a cloud formation template. CloudSploit would be able to flag this as a potential exploit before the template yaml file is deployed.

##Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities

"Amazon ECR" is the tool I would incorporate for AMI/container OS vulnerability scanning

### Example vulnerability

Amazon ECR can be used to identify previously documented exploitable vulnerabilities in unpatched OS versions. Additionally, ECR can flag potential misconfigurations or situations where further "security hardening" can be applied.

##Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities

"AWS Inspector" would be used as an AWS environment cloud configuration vulnerability scanner

### Example vulnerability

AWS Inspector can be used to identify many broad AWS specific vulnerabilities such as when the root account doesn't have multi-factor authentication enabled (MFA).
