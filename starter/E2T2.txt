Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

Both AWS Inspector and Security Hub reference issues related to the "Principle of Least Privilege". The Inspector findings, based on the "Network Reachability" rules, point to open ports on the application ec2 instance other than the required - port 5000. Security Hub reports failures on the CIS AWS Foundations compliance guidelines related overly-permissive and unrestricted security groups applied to the application ec2 instance.

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

In both cases of the aforementioned vulnerabilities, further configuration of the security groups applied to the application ec2 instance is needed - at a minimum to restrict ingress on unused ports. For example, removal of the inbound rule that permits access to the instance on port 22 (ssh).
